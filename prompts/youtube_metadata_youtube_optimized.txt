**Create HIGH-RETENTION YouTube metadata optimized for algorithm and human curiosity:**

Story: "{story_content}"

**🎯 YOUTUBE OPTIMIZATION RULES:**
1. Titles MUST create curiosity gap (not just describe content)
2. First line of description MUST hook attention
3. Use psychological triggers: tension, stakes, transformation
4. Optimize for click + watch time (not just clicks)

**Generate the following:**

**TITLE** (50-60 characters max):
Create a curiosity-driven, high-CTR title using these proven formulas:

❌ AVOID (Wise but low-tension):
- "Finding Peace in Daily Life"
- "The Power of Gratitude" 
- "How to Stay Calm"
- "A Story About Patience"

✅ USE (Curiosity + Stakes + Benefit):
- "This Habit Saved Her From Burnout"
- "What She Learned After Losing Everything"
- "The Mistake That Destroys Your Peace Daily"
- "He Was About to Quit — Then This Happened"
- "The 3 AM Discovery That Changed Everything"

**Title Formula Options:**
1. **Hidden Cost**: "This [X] Silently Destroys Your [Y] (Most Don't Notice)"
2. **Transformation**: "What [Person] Discovered After [Crisis]"
3. **Mistake/Warning**: "The [X] Mistake Costing You [Y] Every Day"
4. **Before/After**: "[Person] Was [Bad State] — Then [Dramatic Change]"
5. **Secret/Discovery**: "[Person] Found [X] in the Most Unexpected Place"
6. **Stakes**: "She Nearly Lost [X] Before Learning This"
7. **Contradiction**: "The [Opposite Thing] That Actually [Result]"

**Title Checklist:**
- ✅ Creates curiosity gap (doesn't reveal the answer)
- ✅ Implies stakes (what could be lost/gained)
- ✅ Suggests transformation (before → after)
- ✅ Uses specific details (not generic)
- ✅ Avoids weak words (maybe, probably, kind of)
- ✅ Passes "scroll test" (would YOU click?)

**DESCRIPTION** (First 150 characters are CRITICAL):

**First Line (The Hook)** - Must grab attention immediately:
❌ "In this video, we share a story about..."
✅ "Most people make this mistake every single day — here's what it's costing you."

**Full Description Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Start with tension or curiosity
2. **Story Summary** (2-3 sentences): Tease the transformation without spoiling
3. **Value Promise** (1-2 sentences): What viewers will gain
4. **Engagement CTA** (1-2 sentences): Like, subscribe, comment question
5. **Keywords**: Naturally include 3-5 relevant search terms

Example:
"Most people never see this coming. [Character] was [crisis situation] when [turning point]. What happened next revealed something unexpected about [theme].

Watch this story and discover [specific benefit]. You might recognize yourself in [character's] journey.

💡 Question: Have you ever experienced [relatable situation]? Share your story in the comments.

**TAGS** (15-20 tags):
Mix of:
- **High-volume keywords** (life advice, personal growth, inspiration)

Example tag strategy:

5-7 emotional tags (overcoming adversity, finding hope)
3-5 format tags (real story, true transformation, inspiring story)

- **Human face** with strong emotion (stress → relief)
- **Text overlay**: 3-5 words MAX from title's most curious part
- **High contrast**: Bold colors, thick outlines
- **Emotional symbols**: Visual metaphor for transformation
- **Top placement**: Text at TOP (YouTube UI covers bottom)

Example: Face showing stress → calm, with text "This Saved Her" at top, arrow/transformation symbol visible
