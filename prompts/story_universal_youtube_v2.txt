- "What [Person] Discovered After [Dramatic Event] Will Change How You See [X]"
- "The [X] Mistake Nobody Talks About (And How It Nearly Ruined Her Life)"

**DESCRIPTION** (3-4 sentences):
Hook → Stakes → Journey preview → Watch to discover

**STORY CONTENT:**

1. **OPENING HOOK (30-50 words)**: 
   Start with the MOMENT OF CRISIS. Drop us into the middle of their breakdown.
   
   Examples:
   - "The text message sat on her phone, unread for three days. Sarah knew what it said. She just couldn't face it yet."
   - "Marcus found himself at the edge of the bridge at 2 AM, not sure if he came to think or to jump."
   - "When the eviction notice arrived, Elena didn't cry. She was too numb for that. Twenty years of work, gone."
   
   Then pull back: "But this wasn't where her story started..."

2. **CHARACTER INTRODUCTION & WORLD (150-200 words)**: 
   WHO are they really? What's their world like?
   - What do they care about deeply?
   - What relationships define them?
   - What's their daily reality?
   - What keeps them going (before the crisis)?
   - Show their LIFE, not just their job title
   
   **Add sensory details**: 
   - What does their morning look like?
   - What do they smell, hear, notice?
   - What small things bring them joy?
   - Who do they text at the end of a hard day?

3. **THE BUILD-UP: How Things Went Wrong (200-250 words)**:
   NOT sudden disaster - show the ACCUMULATION:
   - First sign something's off (they ignore it)
   - Small compromises that add up
   - Relationships showing strain
   - Health declining (sleep, stress, physical)
   - The moment they realize it's serious
   - The moment they realize it's VERY serious
   
   Include DIALOGUE:
   - Argument with spouse/friend/family
   - Boss's disappointed comment
   - Kid asking "Why are you always tired?"
   - Doctor's concerned tone
   
   Show INTERNAL THOUGHTS:
   - "Just get through today"
   - "Tomorrow I'll fix this"
   - "I can handle this"
   - Then: "I can't handle this anymore"

4. **THE BREAKING POINT (100-150 words)**: 
   The crisis that forces change:
   - NOT just one bad day - the day they can't lie to themselves anymore
   - What did they lose? Almost lose?
   - What scared them enough to try something different?
   - Who or what made them pause?
   
   Make this VISCERAL:
   - Panic attack in bathroom
   - Missing child's recital
   - Saying something they regret
   - Physical collapse
   - Financial devastation
   - Relationship ultimatum

5. **THE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS (150-200 words)**:
   Show them TRYING different things first:
   - What didn't work?
   - Who gave bad advice?
   - What made things worse temporarily?
   - Their skepticism, resistance
   - False starts and setbacks
   
   THEN the turning point:
   - Overheard conversation with FULL CONTEXT
   - Chance encounter that becomes meaningful
   - Rock-bottom clarity
   - Something a child/stranger/elder says
   - Book/article/video that clicks
   - Dream or memory that surfaces
   
   Show WHY this particular moment broke through their defenses.

6. **THE PRACTICE: APPLYING THE WISDOM (200-250 words)**:
   This is NOT "and then everything was fine"
   
   Show the MESSY IMPLEMENTATION:
   - First awkward attempts
   - Initial skepticism from others
   - Backsliding and self-doubt
   - Small wins that keep them going
   - Who noticed first? What did they say?
   - When did THEY notice the change?
   
   Make it SPECIFIC:
   - Not "she practiced gratitude" → "Every morning before coffee, she wrote three things in her beat-up notebook. Some days it was just 'the hot water still works' but she wrote something."
   - Not "he set boundaries" → "When his boss texted at 9 PM, Marcus stared at his phone for five minutes. Then he turned it off. His hands were shaking."
   
   Show RELATIONSHIP CHANGES:
   - How did spouse/kids/friends react?
   - Awkward conversations
   - Rebuilding trust
   - Surprising support from unexpected people

7. **THE TRANSFORMATION: 3-6 Months Later (100-150 words)**:
   What's ACTUALLY different?

   - Relationships that improved (HOW?)
   - Health markers (sleep, energy, mood)
   - Work/life balance shifts
   - New perspectives on old problems
   
   INCLUDE setbacks:
   - "Some days are still hard"
   - "It's not perfect"
   - "But now I have tools"
   
   Show ONE MOMENT that proves the change:
   - Same situation as before, different response
   - Someone notices and comments
   - They surprise themselves
   - They help someone else now

8. **UNIVERSAL WISDOM & CALL TO ACTION (100-120 words)**: 
   Connect back to opening hook - answer what you promised
   
   Give viewers THREE things:
   1. **The Core Insight**: What did the character REALLY learn?
   2. **Why It Matters**: How is this relevant to viewers' lives TODAY?
   3. **The First Step**: ONE specific action to take in the next 24 hours
   
   Make it personal:
   - "If you recognized yourself in this story..."
   - "You don't have to wait for a breaking point..."
   - "Start with something small - just like [Character] did"

**ENGAGEMENT OUTRO SLIDE** (7-10 seconds):
"If this story resonated, you're not alone. Like, subscribe, and share this with someone who needs to hear it. What part of [Character]'s journey did you connect with? Tell us in the comments."

**BRANDING OUTRO** (3-5 seconds):

**What Makes This Different:**
- OLD: "Sarah was stressed → discovered meditation → felt better"
- NEW: "Sarah's marriage was failing. Her daughter asked why mommy was always crying. She tried therapy, medication, running away. Nothing worked. Until a 3 AM panic attack led to an unexpected phone call with an old friend she'd been avoiding. That conversation didn't fix everything. But it started something. Six months of messy, imperfect practice later, her daughter said: 'Mommy's smile is back.' Sarah still has hard days. But now she knows she's not alone in them."
