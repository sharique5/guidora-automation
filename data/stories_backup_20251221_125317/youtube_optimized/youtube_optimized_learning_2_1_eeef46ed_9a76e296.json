Think again.\"\n\n**Then introduce character:**\n\"Sarah, a night-shift nurse, was on the brink of a breakdown.\"\n\n2. **CHARACTER & SCENARIO:**\nSarah, a dedicated nurse, loved her job but the endless night shifts and high-pressure environment started taking a toll. Despite being a caregiver, she forgot to care for herself. She felt isolated as her personal relationships began to crumble and her health deteriorated. It wasn't just fatigue; it was a deep mental and emotional drain that no amount of sleep could fix.\n\n3. **THE CHALLENGE:**\nOne night, alone in the break room, Sarah found herself wondering if she could continue. Her hands trembled with exhaustion, her mind foggy with stress. She was at a crisis point where not only her career was at stake, but her well-being and happiness were dangling by a thread. The person known for healing others was now silently breaking apart.\n\n4. **THE INSIGHT:**\nDuring a particularly tough night, Sarah overheard a conversation between two older nurses discussing how they found solace and strength in daily recitation and reflection on the Quran. Initially skeptical, Sarah was desperate for anything that could restore her peace. One quiet morning, she sat down with a copy from the hospital's chapel and began to read. The verses spoke to her turmoil and gradually instilled a calmness she hadn't felt in years.\n\n5. **THE TRANSFORMATION:**\nSarah made it a ritual to spend a few minutes with the Quran before each shift. It wasn’t long before her colleagues began noticing a change. She was calmer, more present, and radiated a serene confidence. Her improved mental clarity and renewed passion not only salvaged her career but also mended her strained relationships. Sarah’s simple habit of daily recitation brought profound changes to her chaotic life.\n\n6. **UNIVERSAL TAKEAWAY:**\nRemember the hook? It’s not about having time; it’s about making time.
